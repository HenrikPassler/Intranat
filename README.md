Elasticsearch
-------------

We use Elasticsearch as our prefered search engine. Here's a few things you might need:

#### List indexes
<sup>*Note:* If the response is ```health status index pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size``` you have no indexes.</sup>
```
$ curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
```

#### Delete all indexes
<sub>*Note:* For this to work, you need to make sure that the setting ```action.destructive_requires_name``` is set to false. Settings it to true will disabel the option to delete all indexes at once.</sub>
```
$ curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_all'
```

#### Delete specific index
```
$ curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/<index_name>'
```
